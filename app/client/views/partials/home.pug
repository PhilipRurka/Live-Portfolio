          | I was on my way to becoming a licensed red seal carpenter with three out of the four blocks required to complete the college program. On december of 2016, I had gotten laid off for the winter due to shortage of work. Considering that I never was very good at standing still for too long, I took my brothers advice and jumped into a basic tutorial video on HTML. I ended up taking 10 months off of everything and dedicated all of my time to learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. Since the day I began learning about “Hello World” of Front-End, I’ve been madly passionate and can’t seem to satisfy my hunger for more. If I am not outside being active, I am inside working on the latest features for a client, personal projects, learning and/or finding ways to improve my quality of life. A healthy life means I can keep pushing forward, doing the things I love to do such as bringing beautiful designs to life and solving complex problems with simple solutions.

          | After 10 months of intense learning, Simptek offered me a one month unpaid internship. To be honest, I didn’t get much sleep during those days considering there were some frameworks that needed to be learned (Angular.js). Failure wasn't and still isn’t an option. I always do whatever it takes to get the job done. After the internship, I had become a fulltime employee. I have been working at SimpTek for a year and a half now (October 2end will be my two year anniversary). Hands down, one the best teams I got to work with. I am grateful that it's a startup, what better way is there to learn how to work in a fast paced environment, work closely with other departments as well as adapt to new scope changes and adjustments with ease.
