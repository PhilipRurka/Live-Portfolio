          The first thing I have learned about Developers is how helpful and friendly they are. They took this open source to heart and share their passion with the world. On a daily basis, I might add! Itâ€™s absolutely amazing if you think about it. Anytime I make a form of online post, about some issues I am having with any kind of code or concept, someone is there to help. Heck, event when someone has clearly given you a well thought out answer, other problem solving enthusiasts still take the time to share with you a different solution, their solution. It blows my mind how generous this community is. I am proud to be part of this community of Developers. Anyway, before I get all teared up, I would like to share with you some of the resources that have and still help me to this day.
