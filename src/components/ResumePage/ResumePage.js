            , Fredericton, NB</span>
          <span>December 2016 - February 2019</span>
          <p>
            My first position in the Tech Industry was an internship at SimpTek. After 1 month of being an intern, I was employed. I joined a team of well skilled developers and had much to learn. During my 2 years of working at this innovative startup, I went from:
            <span className='bullet'>Spending little time on sleep and many extra hours at cafes to learn what an API was, what to do with them and how to develop in Angular1.</span>
            to
            <span className='bullet'>Being Team Lead of the Technology Department.</span>
          </p>
          <p>By the time I grew to Team Lead, my responsibilities were the following:
            <span className='bullet'>Front-End Development</span>
            <span className='bullet'>On a basic level, managed the tech team</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Delegate tasks to the Front-End team</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Represented the tech team in meetings</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Conducted demoâ€™s of the current product & upcoming features</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Conduct & lead meetings</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Create new or adjust previous processes</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Hold a monthly feedback & retrospective sessions with every individual within the Tech Team</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Ensure no one within the tech team is blocked and if they were, work toward unblocking them</span>
            <span className='bullet'>Research on new technologies to better the efficiency and effectiveness of the Tech Team</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The projects I worked on were the Building360 Dashboard, their website, custom dynamic emails and custom email signatures.
            <span className='bullet'><strong>Building360 Dashboard:</strong> I had a major part in building their version 1 and version 2 of their Dashboard. Within this project, I had implemented multiple custom and interactive Graphs that would dictate information displayed in a filterable table and vise versa. I got to build the Login, Reset Password, Registration process and all of their emails.</span>
            <span className='bullet'><strong>SimpTek Website:</strong> I had redesigned the styling folder structure and built version 2 from scratch.</span>
            I can share more details regarding these projects in person.
          </p>
          <p>
          I can elaborate more in person as to what processes and implementations I brought forward to better the efficiency, effectiveness and culture of the overall Tech Team.
          </p>
          <p>My main reasons for leaving are:
            <span className='bullet'>I really wanted to live in Montreal. Fredericton is a small town, too small for this hungry hustler.</span>
            <span className='bullet'>I wanted to let go of Angular1 and become proficient in ReactJs.</span>
            <span className='bullet'>I wanted to have taste of Freelancing. There is a lot to gain when exposing yourself to different environments, practices, styles and teams.</span>

            I was brought in as an hourly rate contractor that ended up lasting 2 months. During my time there, I worked on a 2 week deadline for their Marketplace site. With 100 hour in and the help of their backend team, we delivered! I also worked on re-building their entire website. During that process, I got to work with Google Maps and some of its custom actions.

          <span>Our Remote Developers</span>
          <span className='sar-titles'>Situation:</span>
          <p>
            When I became Team Lead at SimpTek, I felt it was important to get closer to each of my team members and dive deeper into our culture. I knew my team members from the Fredericton office very well, considering I spent my days working beside them, however, there were two developers located in the Halifax office (Different city in a different province) that I only really got to know through meetings and work interactions. My worries were that they may not feel included in our work and/or team culture and they may be missing some elements in their work environment that could better their work efficient/effective, engagement and more importantly, their health. I also wanted to better understand what it was like to be a remote worker and see what improvements can be done to better help them feel included.
          </p>
          <span className='sar-titles'>Action:</span>
          <p>
            I decided to move to Halifax for a month (Entirely out of my own pocket). I rented an apartment that was far enough from the office that allowed me to experience a 2 hour daily commute. I wanted, to the best of my abilities, experience their day to day.
          </p>
          <span className='sar-titles'>Result:</span>
          <p>
            As a result, I better understood what it was like to be a remote worker within the Tech Team.
            I got closer to my, now friends from Halifax (We went fishing a couple occasions while I was there). I was able to make some requests for some office supplies and other supplies that helped them out tremendously. Since my trip to Halifax, I had noticed a positive shift in their behaviour and overall engagement.
            As a Team Lead, itâ€™s important to create connections, establish healthy dynamics and promote a positive culture with your team members.
